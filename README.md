## Cog Documentation

### AutoReact

This cog allows mods to add auto reactions to certain phrases.

`[p]autoreact`

### AutoReply

This cog automatically responds to messages that match specific trigger phrases, set by admins.

`[p]autoreact`

### Convert

Converts any unit to any another unit.

`[p]convert`

### Enforcer

This cog allows you to enforce certain characteristics on a channel.

`[p]enforcer`

There are numerous attributes than can be used to restrict messages/content into a channel.

While some attributes are available in discord via role-based permissions, sometimes a bot may be better off enforcing content in a pinch.

#### Configure Enforcer

`[p]enforcer configure <channel> <attribute> [value]`

Example:

- `[p]enforcer configure #channel enabled true`

| Attribute           | Type   | Description                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`           | `bool` | Whether to enable enforcements on a channel                                                                      |
| `minchars`          | `int`  | How many characters a message must contain to be allowed into the channel                                        |
| `notext`            | `bool` | The sent message must have _no_ text, i.e. should be an image-only message                                       |
| `requiremedia`      | `bool` | The sent message must contain an attached image                                                                  |
| `nomedia`           | `bool` | The sent message must **not** contain an attached image                                                          |
| `minimumguildage`   | `int`  | How old a server member must be part of the guild, in seconds, before they are able to contribute to the channel |
| `minimumdiscordage` | `int`  | How old a member's discord account must be, in seconds, before they are able to contribute to the channel        |

An example enforcement would be a channel to show off server pictures.
In which case, you could allow members to post a set of images with a description of their setup.

In which case, the following would be appropriate

```
[p]enforcer logchannel #admin-log
[p]enforcer configure #serverpics requiremedia true
[p]enforcer configure #serverpics minimumguildage 600
[p]enforcer configure #serverpics minchars 20
[p]enforcer configure enabled true
```

### Feed

This cog allows users to feed each other.

### Google

This cog allows users to send google links to each other.

`[p]google <query>`

### Latex

This cog allows users to display complex mathematical information using LaTeX renderings.

`[p]latex <latex statement>`

### Notes

Manage notes and warnings against users.

`[p]notes`
`[p]warnings`

Notes can be used for long-term storage information of problematic users or for future reference.

When listing the notes of a user, the warnings will be prioritised as they will be deemed more important.

It is possible to add notes to a user who has left or not yet joined. Notes are stored against a user's ID and do not require the user to be part of the server.
Deleting a note does not actually delete the note. It simply marks it in the datastore as deleted and does not show it in normal use. This can allow future recovery of notes if a bad party is attempting to wipe existing notes.

### Penis

This cog allows users to check the size of their penis.

`[p]penis <user>`

### Purge

This cog will purge users that hold no roles as a way to combat accounts being created and left in an un-verified state.

`[p]purge`

- `[p]purge schedule "0 */6 * * *"` - It is possible to run the purge on a schedule. By default, it is **disabled**, but configured for `0 */6 * * *` which is a crontab for every 6 hours. E.g. will run at `00:00`, `06:00`, `12:00` and `18:00` every day.

- `[p]purge minage 5` It will attempt to prune users that hold _no_ roles, that have been part of the server for at least `<minage>` days (default to 5). `<minage>` can be altered to fit your server's requirements to ensure that people that joined but never verified, are not clogging up mention lists and to keep activity ratios high.

By default, purge's schedule is disabled and must be enabled to prune unverified users.

- `[p]purge simulate` - It's possible to do a simulated purge by running `[p]purge simulate`. This will retrieve the list of users it would prune, had it run as normal. This allows moderators to test out configuration without performing any permanent actions.

- `[p]purge exclude @Sneezey#2695` - If a user does not hold any roles for any reason, but you wish to exclude them from the purge, it is possible to add this user to the `exclude` list. This action can also be undone with the `include` subcommand.

- `[p]purge status` - To check how many users have been purged any other configuration items, the status command allows you to see the values in an easy-to-see embed.

### Quotes

This cog will allow members to add quotes to the quotes channel easily.

`[p]quote`

### Reactrole

Allows roles to be applied and removed using reactions.

`[p]reactrole`

### Report

This cog will allow members to send a report into a channel where it can be reviewed and actioned upon by moderators.

- `[p]reports logchannel #admin-log` - For reports to be able to be taken, a log channel must be set which will receive an embed upon a user using the report command.

- `[p]reports channel [allow|deny] [channel]` - Disallow the `report`/`emergency` commands to be used in certain channels

- `[p]reports confirm [true|false]` - When a report is issued, this sets whether the bot will DM the user with confirmation or not

- `[p]report [message]` - A report can be sent to the logchannel for any moderators to see and action upon when they are ready.

- `[p]emergency [message]` - An emergency can be requested which will ping all members in the configured logchannel if they are online.

### Roleinfo

Allows you to view info on a role

- `[p]roleinfo <role>`

### Verify

This cog will allow users to prove they're not a bot by having to read rules and complete an action. They will then be given the verified role if they can complete this.

- `[p]verify block <user>` - Add the specified user to the verification blocklist.
- `[p]verify channel <channel>` - Set the channel in which the cog listens for verification attemps.
- `[p]verify logchannel <channel>` - Set the channel in which the cog logs verification attemps.
- `[p]verify message <message>` - Set the verification string (e.g. `I agree to the rules`.
- `[p]verify role <role>` - Set the role to which users are added upon successful verification.

Further configuration options can be seen with `[p]verify help`

### xkcd

This cog allows users to look at xkcd comics

`[p]xkcd <comicnumber>`
