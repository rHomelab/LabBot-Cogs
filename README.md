## Cog Documentation

### Verify

This cog will allow users to prove they're not a bot by having to read rules and complete an action. They will then be given the verified role if they can complete this.

### Purge

This cog will purge users that hold no roles as a way to combat accounts being created and left in an un-verified state.
